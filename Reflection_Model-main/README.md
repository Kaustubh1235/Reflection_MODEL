#  Cybersecurity-Focused Reflective QA System – Agentic Long-Form Answering Pipeline

A hybrid question-answering pipeline combining T5 and GROQ LLMs, designed specifically for cybersecurity. This system leverages agentic reasoning and self-reflective feedback loops to continuously refine responses, making it highly accurate, adaptable, and context-aware for threat analysis queries.


##  Features

-  **Cybersecurity Domain Expertise** – Tailored to questions on vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10, CVEs, threats, exploits, etc.
-  **Agentic Feedback Loops** – Self-critiquing architecture using LLM-generated rewrites to improve factuality and clarity.
-  **Memory-Enhanced Reasoning** – Incorporates previous user sessions and feedback into response refinement.
-  **Reduced False Positives** – 35% improvement in vulnerability assessments via layered reflection.
-  **Performance-Oriented** – Achieved 92% QA accuracy and 40% response quality improvement over baseline models.

##  Technologies Used

- **GROQ LLM** – For self-reflective critique and rewrite loops  
- **T5 Model** – For initial QA generation  
- **Agentic AI** – Patterned interaction cycles (critique ➝ rewrite)  
- **Python, TensorFlow** – Core ML logic and pipeline orchestration  
- **LangChain / LangGraph** – (Optional) for tool integration and routing logic
